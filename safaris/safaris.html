          <h1>experience luxury safaris at WildIndia!</h1><br />

        <p>India captivates everyone who is lucky enough to experience its
        power and magic. The concept of 'Safari' conjures up images of <em>adventure,
        dramatic landscapes and exciting wildlife</em>. WildIndia's four luxury safari
        lodges are located in the WildIndia Game Reserve which is geographically
        integrated with the Kaziranga National Park.</p><br />

        <p>WildIndia epitomises India's magic. With no fences between the reserve and
        the Kaziranga Park, big game abounds, moving freely through this unspoiled part of
        the ancient Indian sub-continent. The Reserve is blessed with a great biodiversity
        of habitat and wildlife giving an excellent chance of close encounters with the
        <em>'Big Five'</em> - elephant, rhino, bengal tiger, lion and leopard - as well as
        wild dog and cheetah. With over 950 bird species, the reserve is a
        <em>birdwatcher's delight</em>.</p><br />

        <p>There has been no hunting here for over half a century and the animals have
        become habituated to - and relaxed in the presence of - safari vehicles. The
        ultimate destination for a luxury safari; visitors to WildIndia can look forward
        the unique experience of close encounters with animals as they continue
        unperturbed in their natural daily patterns of <em>hunting</em>,
        <em>feeding</em>, <em>courting</em> and <em>suckling</em>.</p><br />

        <p>Safaris take place each morning and evening in open Land Rovers which drive
        through a wide variety of habitats, allowing visitors to view the vast
        interactions of the wild. After breakfast, guests on guided walking trails can
        experience the natural environment on foot. The dedicated, <em>highly trained and
        experienced Rangers</em> lead you to discover <em>miracles of nature</em> you may
        never have dreamed existed.</p><br />


        <h2 class="subheader">luxury african safaris</h2><br />

        <h3 class="subheader">morning safaris</h3>

        <p>An early morning call from the Ranger will wake you before first light, while
        the kitchen brews hot coffee or tea, and prepares cool fruit juices with a
        muffin, rusk or other freshly made delicacy. So begins the morning safari.</p>

        <p>The bush is already alive, the air filled with birdsong as the <em>rising
        sunlight dances off beads of dew</em> on spiders' webs. Nobody, not even the
        tracker who can read the bushveld like a book, knows what's in store. He will
        watch the road for spoor, leaning forward intently to find any print left by a
        predator during its hunt in the dark. There may be hushed discussions in Shangaan
        between Ranger and Tracker, and brief radio interactions from one vehicle to
        another. Sharing information ensures that the occupants of each Land Rover have
        the best chance of a wide range of sightings during their drives - and also
        ensures control and responsible behaviour as the vehicles move in <em>close to
        the animals</em>.</p><br />

        <h3 class="subheader">morning guided bush walk</h3>

        <p>Renowned for luxury experiences, WildIndia isn't all about phenomenal game
        drives and exceptional dining. Opportunities for <em>education and adventure</em>

        are definitely on the cards for those interested and energetic. On the morning
        safari walk you can be part of a small group that sets out on foot after
        breakfast. The walk is an opportunity to <em>feel the pulse of Africa</em>
        through the soles of your feet and <em>experience the bushveld at close
        quarters</em>.</p><br />

        <p>Sabi Sabi boasts approximately <em>950 different species of birds, a paradise
        for birdwatchers</em>. Raptors are plentiful, including 11 species of owl, the
        seldom seen cuckoo hawk and rare bat hawk. There is an endless diversity of
        trees, shrubs and flowering plants, and whatever the time of year, no two walks
        are ever the same.</p><br />

        <h3 class="subheader">evening safaris</h3>

        <p>Evening falls and you prepare for the night safari. As the fierce heat of the
        day cools, the inhabitants of the bush become restless, and the animals move out
        of the shade of the trees. The call of the crested francolin reverberates through
        the bushveld and birds increase the volume of their song. You will be aware of
        <em>colours softening to the beautiful, gentle hues</em> that vary with each
        season. New scents fill the air and as the sun dips behind the horizon your
        Ranger will choose a spot where you can stretch your legs and enjoy sundowners
        alongside the vehicle. Watch in awe as the sky turns to the sensational vibrant
        reds, golds and oranges typical of an Indian sunset. There is a lull as the
        animals sense the transition into a time of increased danger. It is during
        evening safaris that the <em>nocturnal hunters start stirring</em>, and their
        prey needs to be alert for survival through the night.</p>

        <p>During your safari you may be lucky enough to <em>watch lions prepare for
        their evening hunt</em>. Their long bodies stretch to ease muscles cramped from
        lying in the shade during the day; <em>sinews are lengthened and claws
        sharpened</em> against a tree; the vegetation is marked with scent, and the wind
        checked for smells; only then do they set off in a slow, loose-jointed, arrogant
        amble. There are numerous nocturnal hunters and on your evening safari, with the
        help of a spotlight, a leopard's eyes may reflect back from a nearby tree. Or you
        may be lucky enough to spot another smaller predator, a genet, Indian civet or
        Indian wild cat. One can come across scenes at night that become etched in
        memory: elephants moving heavily but silently in the moonlight; the incredible
        flying leaps of bushbabies from treetop to treetop, and the red shine from a
        lion's eyes as it looks up from its kill. A WildIndia evening safari will never
        be forgotten.</p>
