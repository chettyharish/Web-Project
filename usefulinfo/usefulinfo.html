<h2 class="subheader">recommended equipment</h2><br />
<h3 class="subheader">camera bodies</h3>
<p>Any good camera will do. One gets so close to the wildlife that even a good compact camera will achieve fantastic shots. However, if you want
		flexibility and the opportunity of capturing that really fantastic shot then any good quality digital or 35mm SLR (single lens reflex, as opposes to a
		compact camera with automatic controls) camera body will be needed. There are many models and makes to look at, but it's important that the camera
		shoots at least five frames per second so that you do not miss the action. With a compact camera there is a slight delay between pushing the trigger
		and the shot being captured; whereas a SLR is instant. Some of the new Nikon SLR cameras offer excellent low-light capabilities giving you more
		opportunities when the light begins to fade.</p><br /><br />
		<h3 class="subheader">suggested lens selection</h3>
<p>You will get extremely close to wildlife so it is not necessary to have huge lenses. A good zoom lens is your best option and will offer best
		flexibility.</p><br /><br />

<h3 class="subheader">zoom lenses</h3>
<p>Fast lenses with an F stop of F4 through to F2.8 are best. Great all purpose lenses in this range are the 70-200mm f2.8, 200-400 f4 or 100-400 f5.6
		lenses. With both these lenses you will have plenty on lens at all times and enough speed to keep your image nice and sharp.</p><br /><br />
<h3 class="subheader">multi purpose lenses</h3>
<p>Most SLR bodies come with a standard lens; otherwise a lens with a 24-70mm range would be ideal to take landscape shots and general travel/ people shots.</p><br /><br />
<h3 class="subheader">prime or fixed lenses</h3>
<p>These are lenses that have a fixed length starting from 200mm and going up to 600mm. These are excellent lenses but very expensive and not always
		necessary. These lenses are wonderful in low light conditions, are very fast and offer great abrasion/shallow depths of fields giving your portrait
		shot that sharp look with a blurred background. However, they do tend to be heavy and need to be shot on a tripod or support of some kind.</p><br /><br />
<h3 class="subheader">converters</h3>
<p>Put in a 1.4 or 2 x converter if you can. It's always worth having and gives your lens that little more if you realty need it or if you want to take
		photos of birds.</p><br /><br />
		<h3 class="subheader">support systems</h3>

		<p>In order to get that sharp image, you need to make sure that you are shooting as fast as you can in the light offered, and most importantly you need to
		make sure your camera and lens are as stable as you can make them.</p><br /><br /><br />
            </p>
            <h3 class="subheader">clamps and heads</h3>
<p>All Sabi Sabi Land Rovers have large steel roll bars in front of each seat. The easiest way to get stability is using a G-clamp directly onto the bar
		with a good quality head. Any good ball head or video head will work. The wimberly head is one of the best and very effective, if expensive. The lodges
		are able to supply a G clamp and Manfrotto 501hdv head on request for a small daily hiring charge of R250. This Head and clamp works really well
		especially with the bigger lenses.</p><br /><br />

<h3 class="subheader">tripods and monopods</h3>
<p>A tripod is not usable on the Land Rover itself. You will not have enough room to adjust the legs and will not get enough stability. However, in and
		around the lodge or for that perfect sunset shot, you could use a tripod. A monopod is very popular and works well, using the floor of the Land Rover
		as a base. It is still advisable to put a movable head on the end of the mono.</p><br /><br />

<h3 class="subheader">bean bags</h3>
<p>An old favourite, the bean bag, works very well. They are easy to use and offer lots of support. The down side is that they tend to be heavy. Don't
		worry about bringing the filling along, as this is too heavy. The lodge will gladly offer you rice to fill the bag for your stay. Out of interest, bird
		seed works really well, its very light and settles well plus you can use some of the filling to feed the birds.</p><br /><br />

<h3 class="subheader">flash work</h3>
<p>It's important to have a good flash. A third of the evening safari is at night and in near total darkness. Having a good flash or speedlight will
		certainly help in these conditions. There is no problem with the use of flash at all during our safaris and we would only ask for flashes not to be
		used when the big cats are actively hunting. Each Land Rover will have a tracker and he operates a powerful spotlight. One can easily take photos using
		this light as your only light source - it often creates a lovely effect!</p><br /><br />

		<h3 class="subheader">bags or cases</h3>

		<p>The African bush is a dusty place so it would be a good idea to keep your camera in a bag that seals while you are on safari. It's also a good idea to
		not change lenses while out on safari. This will help to prevent your digital sensor being contaminated by dust particles.</p><br /><br />
		<h3 class="subheader">memory cards and storage</h3>
		<p>Bring a lot of memory with you - either a hard drive or lots of cards. There is no facility at the lodge to purchase cards and there is no way of
		downloading your cards either. So bring a laptop, hardrive or enough memory to last the full stay. I always take more than I expect to use. On a good
		safari I can easily fill up 8 gigs of memory. The more you shoot the more chance you have of getting that prize shot.</p><br /><br />
        <h2 class="subheader">a guide to photography at sabi sabi - settings and tips</h2></li>

<li class="normallessdark"><h2 class="subheader">what to do on safari to get that prized photo</h2><br />

<p>On your arrival let it be known that you enjoy photography and are interested in getting some great shots. While all our Rangers are well trained in
		the art of photography some of the team have made it their passion so by letting us know we will try to make sure your guide can assist you.</p><br />
		<p>
		On each Land Rover there is three rows of seats, with each row a little higher than the one before. I always suggest taking the front row or even the
		seat next to the ranger. You want to be as low to the ground as possible. You will either be shooting over the bonnet or over the side of the vehicle
		so set yourself up accordingly.</p><br />

	<h3 class="subheader">

		camera settings
	</h3>
	<p>
		If you are new to photography and your camera is new then I suggest keeping your camera on "Program" this is normally a P on most top end cameras. Make
		sure your Auto Focus is on and your image stability if your lens has such a function.
	</p><br />
	<p>
		However if you understand a little more about photography and are confidant with your camera I suggest the following. Always shoot in RAW - this is so
		important I can't stress it enough. Granted, it uses up lots of memory but this could be the shot of a lifetime and if it is shot on RAW you have so
		much more flexibly when it comes to processing the shot. For your portrait shot and landscape shots always use "Aperture Priority" this lets you choose
		the Aperture and the camera will automatically select the camera speed for you. By doing this you can control your depth of field. In general keep the
		Aperture on F6.3 and F7.1. This will make sure that your entire portrait is in focus.</p><br /> <p>But beware make sure that you are getting enough speed especially
		when the light starts to fade. Rule of thumb is that your speed should never be below the length of your lens. For example: if you are using a 200mm
		lens you should never shoot below 1/200<sup>th</sup> of a second or you risk camera shake. To prevent this happening especially when the light is low
		do not hesitate to use a much higher ISO. On most of the new cameras you can easily take the ISO up to 1000 without the image being too grainy. I
		personally will keep my camera set on f7.1 and ISO 400 achieving speeds of 1/1600 to 1/2000 during the day and pushing my ISO up to 800 in the early morning
		and late afternoon and even at times taking this up to ISO 1200. Remember the more speed you can get the better chance of the image being
		sharp.
	</p><br />

	<p>If you plan to try and shoot lots of action shots then "Speed Priority" is a must. To freeze a shot you would set a speed of at least 1/1600 and up,
		the camera will automatically set your aperture. Again be aware that your aperture is not falling too low if it is pushing up your ISO again. Here I
		would probably leave my camera on ISO 800 all the time. This would also	ensure a lot of speed.</p><br />

<h3 class="subheader">focus</h3>
		<p>Most of the newer cameras allow you to move your focus sensor square around manually on the frame. Do this and always make sure that you place the
		sensor on the eye of the animal where possible. A sharp eye always gives the image a much sharper look.</p><br /><br />

<p>Guests at WildIndia! now have access to 24-hour on-site medical assistance, thanks to the implementation of a programme by Indian SAFE-T (Safari and Adventure Emergency Team).
Any medical complaint from minor ailments to more serious conditions and injuries are dealt with by a fully trained medical team, one of whom is based on the reserve, with
the others at an off-site facility.</p><br />

<p>Dr. Simon King of SAFE-T explains: &quot;Traditionally, medical complaints in relatively inaccessible area were dealt with by evacuation i.e. moving the patient
to the nearest urban medical facility. Our programme ensures on site response, with evacuation only taking place if absolutely necessary. In serious cases, evacuation time
is reduced to 30 minutes as opposed to several hours, which is usually the case on a game reserve.&quot;</p><br />
<p>WildIndia! Group Operations Director, Rod Wyndham says: &quot;While we hope that we only have to make use of this facility on rare occasions, the reality is that having the SAFE-T team
on board is very reassuring. We now have readily available resources for medical assistance, as opposed to being completely reliant on urban resources.&quot; </p><br />
